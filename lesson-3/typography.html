                <li><strong>Zilla Slab:</strong> is Mozilla's core typeface, used for the Mozilla wordmark, headlines and throughout their designs. A
                contemporary slab serif, based on Typotheque's Tesla, it is constructed with smooth curves and true italics, which gives
                text an unexpectedly sophisticated industrial look and a friendly approachability in all weights.

                <li><strong>Antic Slab:</strong>was designed for use in the headlines of newspapers and magazines. The Antic Type System is a super family
                that is still evolving, and this first release of the Slab family. It complements the Sans and Didone versions, giving
                the designer freedom to create rhythmic and dynamic typography using all three families in the type system. was designed for use in the headlines of newspapers and magazines. The Antic Type System is a super family
