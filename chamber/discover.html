                The Roques Beach
            </h3>
            <p>
                This beautiful archipelago and national park of islands and keys is part of the Venezuelan Lesser
                Antilles. Its largest
                island is Gran Roque, where most of its 3,000 or so inhabitants reside and where the airport that
                provides the main
                access to the territory is located.
            </p>
            <p>Its paradisiacal beaches, with different shades of blue, transparent waters and white sand, are
                considered among the
                purest in the Antilles. Among the keys are Cayo de Agua, Cayo Sal, Cayo Pirata and Cayos Francisqui. The
                Roqueños are
                skilled lobster fishermen, which is why Los Roques is the best place in Venezuela to enjoy this
                delicacy.</p>

            <p>
                It is a National Park located in the western state of Falcón. It has spectacular beaches both on the
                mainland and on its
                different islets and keys near the coast.
            </p>
            <p>The most recognized insular area of Morrocoy is Cayo Sombrero, which has two wide beaches with clear and
                calm waters,
                shaded by coconut palms. Punta Brava is the most visited key since it allows access by car through a
                bridge. On the
                mainland, the largest town in the park is Tucacas, a city of just over 30,000 inhabitants that also has
                beautiful
                beaches.</p>

                a wide beach of diaphanous waters and fine white sand.
            </p>
            <p>During the colony, there were huge cocoa plantations nearby and when Spanish merchants speculated
                downwards with prices,
                the most powerful Venezuelan landowners sold their fruit to Dutch smugglers, who used this and other
                bays of Aragüe to
                load. Near Bahía de Cata there are other splendid beaches, such as Cuyagua, La Ciénaga de Ocumare and
                Ensenadas de
                Chuao.</p>

                It is an uninhabited island in the state of Nueva Esparta that became famous in the 16th century for its
                rich pleasures
                of pearls, which were extracted from the depths by the Guaiquerí Indians by lung diving. It was one of
                the first

            </p>
            <p>The town was destroyed by a tidal wave and the place was no longer repopulated, currently there are only
                a few
                fishermen's houses. It houses some of the most virgin beaches in the country, which can only be reached
                by boat, sailing
                about 10 minutes from the island of Margarita. Among these beaches are Charagato, Falucho and Cabecera.
