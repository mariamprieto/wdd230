                    Primary Sector or Agricultural Sector
                </h3>
                <p>
                    The primary sector, also known as agriculture, is the one that obtains the product from natural
                    resources (both
                    renewable and non-renewable) to later transform it into unprocessed raw materials destined mainly
                    for
                    industrial
                    production and the supply of certain types of services.
                </p>
                <p>Some examples of activities in the primary sector are the
                    following: Agriculture, Livestock, Fishing, Exploitation of forest resources and Mining.</p>

                <p>

                    materials, that is,
                    industry and construction. Thus, while the primary sector is limited to directly obtaining the
                    resources
                    of nature, the
                    secondary sector executes industrial procedures to transform said resources. This transformation
                    activity can also be
                    artisanal, when the production of the goods is carried out in a simple way and involves print runs
                    of
                    few units
                </p>

                    services and goods, for this reason it is also called the service sector. Today, this sector has
                    diversified and grown
                    spectacularly, accounting for up to 70% of the gross domestic product of some developed countries.
